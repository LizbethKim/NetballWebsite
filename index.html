    <p> The whistle had gone, it was the end of the third quarter and the Central Pulse were losing by 3 points. It was a humid evening at the courts just near Amy’s house and her Mum, Dad, twin sisters and friend Emily were there to cheer her on. She was so tired she just wanted to give up but she knew she couldn’t just give up on her team like that, they counted on her, she was determined to win!  </p>
